# GrowEbuddy PSA Diagram Standards

This document outlines the specific standards and conventions for creating diagrams in the GrowEbuddy PSA project.

## General Guidelines

1. All diagrams should be created using Diagram as Code techniques (Mermaid or Python).
2. Use consistent color schemes and styles across all diagrams.
3. Include a title and brief description for each diagram.
4. Use clear and concise labels for all elements in the diagrams.
5. Store all diagram code in the `docs/design/diagrams/` directory.
6. Use version control to track changes in diagram code.

## User Flow Diagrams

- Use Mermaid for creating user flow diagrams.
- Start each flow with a clearly labeled entry point.
- Use decision diamonds for user choices.
- End each flow with a clear exit point or loop back to a previous step.
- Use consistent color coding: green for start, red for end, blue for processes, yellow for decisions.

Example:

mermaid
graph TD
A[Start] --> B{Login?}
B -->|Yes| C[Dashboard]
B -->|No| D[Registration]
D --> C
C --> E{Choose Activity}
E -->|Mini-game| F[Play Mini-game]
E -->|Virtual Space| G[Enter Virtual Space]
F --> C
G --> C

## Wireframes

- Use Python with the Pillow library to create wireframes.
- Maintain a consistent grid system across all screens (e.g., 12-column grid).
- Use grayscale for wireframes to focus on layout and structure.
- Include placeholder text and images to represent content.
- Label key components and interactions.
- Create separate files for mobile and desktop versions if responsive design is required.

## UI Component Library

- Use Python with PyQt or Kivy to create UI components.
- Create a separate file for each component type (e.g., buttons.py, forms.py).
- Include variations for different states (default, hover, active, disabled).
- Use comments to explain the purpose and usage of each component.
- Follow the project's color scheme and typography guidelines.
- Ensure all components are accessible and follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines.

## Information Architecture Diagram

- Use Mermaid to create the information architecture diagram.
- Organize content hierarchically, starting with main sections.
- Use consistent shapes for similar types of content or functionality.
- Include links between related sections to show navigation paths.
- Color-code different types of content or user roles if applicable.

Example:

mermaid
graph TD
A[GrowEbuddy PSA] --> B[Home]
A --> C[Virtual Spaces]
A --> D[Mini-games]
A --> E[Profile]
C --> F[The Cave]
C --> G[Samsara]
D --> H[Memory Pairs]
D --> I[Simon Says Breath]
E --> J[Achievements]
E --> K[Settings]

## High-fidelity Mockups and Prototypes

- Use Python with PyQt or Kivy for creating high-fidelity mockups and prototypes.
- Implement the full color scheme and visual design as specified in the style guide.
- Create separate files for different screens or sections of the app.
- Include comments explaining the logic behind interactive elements.
- Ensure all mockups and prototypes are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
- Include animations and transitions where applicable.

## Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names for all diagram files.
- Follow the format: `[diagram_type]_[feature_name].{md|py}`
- Examples:
  - `user_flow_registration.md`
  - `wireframe_dashboard.py`
  - `ui_component_button.py`
  - `information_architecture_main.md`
  - `mockup_virtual_space.py`

## Review Process

1. All diagrams must be reviewed by at least one other team member before being finalized.
2. Use pull requests for submitting new diagrams or major changes.
3. Include rendered images along with the code in pull requests for easier review.
4. Address all comments and suggestions before merging.

Remember to refer to the DIAGRAM_AS_CODE_GUIDE.md for technical instructions on using Mermaid and Python for creating diagrams.
