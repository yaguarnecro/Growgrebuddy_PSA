# Design Documentation

This folder contains all design-related documentation and assets for the GrowEbuddy PSA project.

## Structure

- `diagrams/`: Contains all design diagrams
  - `user_flows/`: User flow diagrams (Mermaid code and rendered images)
  - `wireframes/`: Wireframes for all main screens (Python scripts and rendered images)
  - `ui_components/`: UI Component Library (Python scripts and rendered images)
  - `information_architecture/`: Information Architecture Diagram (Mermaid code and rendered images)
  - `mockups_and_prototypes/`: High-fidelity Mockups and Prototypes (Python scripts and rendered images)

- `assets/`: Contains design-related assets
  - `images/`: Image files used in the design
  - `icons/`: Icon sets used in the app
  - `fonts/`: Custom fonts used in the design

## Best Practices

1. Always use the latest version of design files.
2. Update the README in each subfolder with links to the current versions of design files.
3. When updating designs, create a new version rather than overwriting existing files.
4. Regularly sync design assets with the development team.
5. Ensure all designs adhere to the established design guidelines and principles.

## Tools

- Mermaid: For user flows and information architecture diagrams
- Python with Pillow: For wireframes
- Python with PyQt5 or Kivy: For UI components and high-fidelity mockups

## Important Documents

- [DIAGRAM_STANDARDS.md](./DIAGRAM_STANDARDS.md): Outlines the specific standards and conventions for creating diagrams in this project.
- [DIAGRAM_AS_CODE_GUIDE.md](./DIAGRAM_AS_CODE_GUIDE.md): Provides technical instructions on using Mermaid and Python for creating diagrams.
