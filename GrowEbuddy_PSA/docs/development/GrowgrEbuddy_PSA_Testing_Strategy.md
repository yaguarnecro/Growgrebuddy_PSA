# GrowgrEbuddy_PSA Testing Strategy

## 1. Testing Levels

### 1.1 Unit Testing
- **Tool:** Jest for frontend, pytest for backend
- **Responsibility:** Developers
- **Coverage Goal:** 80% code coverage

### 1.2 Integration Testing
- **Tool:** Cypress for frontend, pytest for backend
- **Responsibility:** QA team
- **Focus:** API integrations, database interactions

### 1.3 System Testing
- **Tool:** Selenium WebDriver
- **Responsibility:** QA team
- **Scope:** End-to-end workflows, cross-feature interactions

### 1.4 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- **Participants:** Selected beta testers
- **Duration:** 1 week
- **Feedback Method:** In-app feedback form and user surveys

## 2. Testing Types

### 2.1 Functional Testing
- Test all features against PRD specifications
- Create test cases for both positive and negative scenarios

### 2.2 Usability Testing
- Conduct user journey mapping
- Perform heuristic evaluation based on Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics

### 2.3 Performance Testing
- **Tool:** Apache JMeter
- **Metrics:** Response time, throughput, server resource usage
- **Targets:** 
  - Page load time < 3 seconds
  - Support 500 concurrent users

### 2.4 Security Testing
- **Areas:** Authentication, data encryption, API security
- **Tool:** OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning

### 2.5 Compatibility Testing
- Test on latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Ensure responsive design works on various screen sizes

## 3. Automated vs. Manual Testing
- Automate 60% of regression tests
- Manual testing for new features and complex user scenarios

## 4. Test Environment
- Use Docker to create consistent test environments
- Maintain separate testing database with sample data

## 5. Bug Tracking and Reporting
- Use JIRA for bug tracking and management
- Define bug severity levels and resolution priorities

## 6. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipeline
- Run unit and integration tests on every commit
- Perform full system tests before each deployment

## 7. Test Data Management
- Create and maintain a set of test data covering various scenarios
- Ensure test data is refreshed regularly and includes edge cases

## Future Testing Considerations

1. Expanded Performance Testing
   - Implement load testing for higher concurrent user targets
   - Conduct stress testing to determine system limits

2. Accessibility Testing
   - Use tools like WAVE or aXe for automated accessibility checks
   - Conduct manual testing with screen readers and other assistive technologies

3. Localization Testing
   - Test app functionality and content in multiple languages
   - Verify proper handling of different date, time, and number formats

4. Security Penetration Testing
   - Engage third-party security experts for in-depth penetration testing

5. A/B Testing Framework
   - Implement system for running and analyzing A/B tests on new features

This testing strategy provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the quality and reliability of GrowgrEbuddy_PSA. It covers immediate testing needs for the MVP while also considering future testing requirements as the app evolves.
