* **Result Text:** To ensure that no important section is missed in future tickets, it's a good idea to create a template that can be reused whenever a new ticket is created. This template should be stored in a location that is easily accessible to all team members who are responsible for creating or managing tickets. Here are a few suggestions on where to store this template:
Documentation Repository:
Store the template in a dedicated folder within your documentation repository, such as GrowEbuddy_PSA/docs/development/tickets/templates/. This makes it easy for anyone working on documentation to find and use the template.
Project Management Tool:
If you use a project management tool like Jira, Trello, or Asana, you can create a template within the tool itself. Most of these tools allow you to create and save templates for recurring tasks or tickets.
Shared Drive or Cloud Storage:
Use a shared drive or cloud storage service (like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive) to store the template. Ensure that the folder is shared with all relevant team members.
Internal Wiki or Knowledge Base:
If your organization uses an internal wiki or knowledge base (such as Confluence or Notion), you can create a page dedicated to ticket templates. This can also include guidelines on how to fill out each section.
Here's an example of what the template might look like:
By having a standardized template, you ensure consistency and completeness across all documentation tickets.

* **Result Text:** To solve Ticket 1 in Missing_Documentation_Tickets.md as a User Experience (UX) Writer, we need to ensure that the user guides or manuals meet the acceptance criteria specified in the ticket. Let's break down the steps:
Step 1: Compare Existing Files with Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria for User Documentation:
Comprehensive coverage of all application features.
Clear and concise step-by-step instructions.
Reviewed and approved by the UX team.
Existing Files:
GrowEbuddy_PSA/index_technical_documentation.md: This file might contain some technical documentation but is unlikely to be user-focused.
Other files in the GrowEbuddy_PSA/docs/development/tickets/ directory are more likely related to ticket management rather than user guides.
Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Done
Comprehensive Coverage:
Review the application to identify all features and functionalities.
Ensure that each feature is documented in a user-friendly manner.
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Create detailed guides for each feature, including screenshots or diagrams if necessary.
Ensure instructions are clear and easy to follow.
Review and Approval:
Once the documentation is drafted, it should be reviewed by the UX team for clarity and completeness.
Step 3: Create or Modify Necessary Files
Since there are no existing user guides, we will create a new file for the user documentation. Let's create a new markdown file named user_guide.md in the GrowEbuddy_PSA/docs/user_guides/ directory.
Step 4: Update the Ticket
Once the user guide is complete and reviewed by the UX team, update the ticket in Missing_Documentation_Tickets.md:
If you need any clarification or additional information, feel free to ask!

- **user_guide.md seems quite empty. check @PRD.md for the key features  or another important file to describe the features of the application, even if you need to look into the whole @Codebase **

To enhance the user_guide.md with detailed descriptions of the application's features, we can extract relevant information from the PRD.md file, which outlines the key features and functional requirements of the GrowEbuddy P.S.A. application. Here's how you can update the user guide with comprehensive feature descriptions:
Step 1: Extract Key Features from PRD.md
The PRD.md file contains a section on key features and functional requirements, which we can use to populate the user guide. Here are some of the key features mentioned:
Virtual Mascot: Evolves based on user interactions and progress.
Virtual Spaces: Different environments for personal growth activities.
Point System: EXP and Coins for completing activities and purchasing items.
Mini-Games: Games like Memory Pairs and Simon Says Breath.
5. User Progression: Daily login rewards, streak bonuses, and level system.
6. Game Mechanics: Daily quests, habit tracking, mood tracking, etc.
7. Social Features: Friends list, activity feed, challenges, messaging, etc.
Accessibility Features: Color blind mode, text-to-speech, customizable font sizes, etc.
Step 2: Update user_guide.md with Detailed Descriptions
Using the extracted information, we can now update the user_guide.md to provide users with a comprehensive guide on how to use these features:
Explanation:
Detailed Descriptions: Each feature now includes a description and step-by-step instructions on how to use it.
Comprehensive Coverage: The guide covers all major features outlined in the PRD.md, ensuring users have a clear understanding of the app's capabilities.
This updated user guide should provide users with a thorough understanding of how to navigate and utilize the GrowEbuddy application effectively. If you need further modifications or additional features included, feel free to ask!
