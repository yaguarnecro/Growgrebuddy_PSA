* **Result Text:** Yes, the mermaid-js/mermaid-cli is indeed capable of rendering flowcharts. The Mermaid library supports various types of diagrams, including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and more.
Flowchart Syntax in Mermaid
The syntax for creating flowcharts in Mermaid is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to define a flowchart:
Rendering Flowcharts with Mermaid CLI
To render a flowchart using the Mermaid CLI, you would typically follow these steps:
Create a .mmd file with the flowchart code.
Run the Mermaid CLI command to generate an image (PNG, SVG, etc.) from the .mmd file.
For example, if you have a file named flowchart.mmd, you would run:
Common Issues
If you're encountering issues with rendering flowcharts, consider the following:
File Encoding: Ensure your .mmd files are saved with UTF-8 encoding without BOM.
Syntax Errors: Double-check your Mermaid syntax for any errors. The Mermaid Live Editor is a great tool for testing and debugging your diagrams.
Mermaid CLI Version: Make sure you have the latest version of the Mermaid CLI installed. You can update it using:
Dependencies: Ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and up to date.
Conclusion
If you follow the correct syntax and ensure your environment is set up properly, the Mermaid CLI should be able to render flowcharts without any issues. If you continue to experience problems, please share the specific Mermaid code you're trying to render, and I can help troubleshoot further.

* **Result Text:** Let's ensure that all the use case .mmd files are correctly formatted according to the Mermaid syntax for flowcharts. Below are the corrected versions of each use case file, ensuring they follow the proper structure and syntax.
1. User Management Use Cases
2. Core Functionality Use Cases
3. Virtual Spaces Use Cases
4. Mini Games Use Cases
5. Social Features Use Cases
Key Changes Made:
Removed YAML Front Matter: The --- sections were removed as they are not necessary for Mermaid diagrams.
Flowchart Syntax: Used flowchart LR to indicate a left-to-right flowchart.
Node Representation: Used double parentheses (( )) for actors and square brackets [ ] for use cases.
Consistent Formatting: Ensured consistent formatting across all files.
Next Steps:
Save each of these code blocks into their respective .mmd files.
Try rendering them again using the Mermaid CLI:

* **Result Text:** Yes, there are several alternatives to Mermaid for rendering diagrams, especially if you're encountering persistent issues. Here are some popular options:
1. PlantUML
Description: PlantUML is a widely used tool for creating UML diagrams from plain text descriptions. It supports various types of diagrams, including use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, and flowcharts.
Usage: You can write your diagrams in a simple text format and render them to PNG, SVG, or other formats.
Installation: You can run PlantUML using Java or use it with various IDE plugins (like IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code).
Example:
2. Draw.io (diagrams.net)
Description: Draw.io is a web-based diagramming tool that allows you to create diagrams visually. It supports a wide range of diagram types and is user-friendly.
Usage: You can create diagrams directly in your browser and export them in various formats (PNG, SVG, etc.).
Integration: It can be integrated with Google Drive, GitHub, and other platforms for easy collaboration.
Example: You would create diagrams using the drag-and-drop interface.
3. Lucidchart
Description: Lucidchart is another web-based diagramming tool that offers a rich set of features for creating flowcharts, UML diagrams, and more.
Usage: It provides templates and a user-friendly interface for creating diagrams.
Integration: It integrates with various applications like Google Workspace, Microsoft Office, and Slack.
Example: Similar to Draw.io, you would use the visual interface to create diagrams.
4. Graphviz
Description: Graphviz is an open-source graph visualization software that uses a simple text language to describe the graphs.
Usage: It is particularly good for directed and undirected graphs.
Installation: You can install Graphviz on various platforms and use it from the command line.
Example:
5. Doxygen
Description: Doxygen is primarily a documentation generator, but it can also generate diagrams from annotated source code.
Usage: It can create call graphs and collaboration diagrams if you use Graphviz with it.
Example: You would annotate your code and run Doxygen to generate documentation along with diagrams.
Conclusion
If Mermaid is not meeting your needs, any of these alternatives can be a good choice depending on your specific requirements and preferences. Each tool has its strengths, so you might want to try a few to see which one fits best with your workflow. If you need help with any specific tool, feel free to ask!
