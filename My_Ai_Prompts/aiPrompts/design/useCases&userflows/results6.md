## Result 1
* **Result ID:** 1
* **Link to Prompt:** #prompt-2
* **Result Text:** The error message you encountered indicates that the input file specified for rendering does not exist at the given path. This could happen for several reasons:
Possible Reasons for the Error
Incorrect File Path: The path provided in the command may not match the actual location of the file. This could be due to typos or incorrect directory structure.
File Name Case Sensitivity: If you are on a case-sensitive file system (like Linux), ensure that the file names and paths match exactly, including case.
Working Directory: The command may be executed from a different working directory than expected, leading to incorrect relative paths.
4. File Existence: The file may have been moved, deleted, or renamed after the initial check.
How to Fix It
1. Verify File Existence: Check that the file core_functionality.mmd exists in the specified directory.
Check Path: Ensure that the path you are using in the command is correct and matches the actual file structure.
Use Absolute Paths: If you are unsure about the current working directory, use absolute paths for the input and output files.
Solution: Code to Render Each File
Here are the commands to render each file as a .png, using absolute paths. Make sure to replace the paths with the correct absolute paths on your system if necessary.

2. Mini-Games Use Cases
3. Social Features Use Cases
4. User Management Use Cases
5. Virtual Spaces Use Cases
Summary
Verify that the files exist in the specified directory.
Use absolute paths to avoid issues with the current working directory.
Run the provided commands to render each file as a .png.
If you still encounter issues, please double-check the file paths and ensure that the files are indeed present in the specified locations.

## Result 1
* **Result ID:** 1
* **Link to Prompt:** #prompt-3
* **Result Text:** The error message you received indicates that the Mermaid CLI is unable to detect the diagram type from the provided .mmd file. This can happen for a few reasons:
Possible Reasons for the Error
File Encoding Issues: The file may contain hidden characters or be saved in an unsupported encoding format (e.g., UTF-16 instead of UTF-8).
Corrupted File: The file might be corrupted or contain invalid characters that prevent Mermaid from parsing it correctly.
Incorrect Syntax: Although you mentioned that the files are identical to the original version, there might be subtle syntax issues or formatting problems that are not immediately visible.
Mermaid CLI Version: There could be compatibility issues with the version of the Mermaid CLI you are using.
How to Fix It
Check File Encoding: Ensure that the .mmd files are saved in UTF-8 encoding without a BOM (Byte Order Mark). You can use a text editor like Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code to check and change the encoding.
Recreate the Files: If the files are corrupted, try copying the content to a new file and saving it as a .mmd file.
Validate Syntax: Double-check the syntax of the Mermaid diagrams to ensure there are no hidden issues.
Update Mermaid CLI: Make sure you are using the latest version of the Mermaid CLI. You can update it using npm:
Solution: Code to Render Each File
Here are the commands to render each file as a .png, assuming the files are now correctly formatted and saved in UTF-8:
1. Core Functionality Use Cases
2. Mini-Games Use Cases
3. Social Features Use Cases
4. User Management Use Cases
5. Virtual Spaces Use Cases
Summary
Ensure the files are saved in UTF-8 encoding without BOM.
Recreate the files if necessary.
Validate the syntax and update the Mermaid CLI if needed.
Run the provided commands to render each file as a .png.
If you continue to experience issues, please let me know, and we can troubleshoot further.

## Result 1
* **Result ID:** 1
* **Link to Prompt:** #prompt-4
* **Result Text:** To perform the tasks you've outlined, follow these steps for each of the .mmd files in your project. Below, I will provide detailed instructions for each step.
1. Check File Encoding
You can check and change the file encoding using either Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code.
Using Notepad++
Open the .mmd file in Notepad++.
2. Go to the menu bar and click on Encoding.
3. Check if UTF-8 (without BOM) is selected. If not, select Convert to UTF-8 (without BOM).
4. Save the file.
Using Visual Studio Code
1. Open the .mmd file in Visual Studio Code.
2. Look at the bottom right corner of the window; it will show the current encoding.
If itâ€™s not UTF-8, click on it, then select Reopen with Encoding and choose UTF-8.
4. Save the file.
2. Recreate the Files
If you suspect the files might be corrupted, you can recreate them:
Open the .mmd file in your text editor.
Select all the content (Ctrl + A) and copy it (Ctrl + C).
3. Create a new file in your text editor.
Paste the content (Ctrl + V) into the new file.
Save the new file with the same name and ensure it has the .mmd extension.
3. Validate Syntax
To validate the syntax of the Mermaid diagrams:
1. Use an online Mermaid live editor (like Mermaid Live Editor):
Copy the content of each .mmd file.
Paste it into the live editor.
Check for any syntax errors or warnings.
Alternatively, you can run the Mermaid CLI locally to check for errors:
If there are syntax errors, they will be displayed in the terminal.
4. Update Mermaid CLI
To ensure you have the latest version of the Mermaid CLI, follow these steps:
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Run the following command to update the Mermaid CLI:
3. After the installation, you can check the version to confirm the update:
Summary
Check and change file encoding to UTF-8 without BOM using Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code.
Recreate the files if you suspect corruption by copying the content to a new file.
Validate the syntax using the Mermaid live editor or the Mermaid CLI.
Update the Mermaid CLI to the latest version using npm.
By following these steps, you should be able to resolve any issues related to file encoding, corruption, syntax errors, or outdated CLI versions. If you encounter any specific issues during these steps, feel free to ask for further assistance!
