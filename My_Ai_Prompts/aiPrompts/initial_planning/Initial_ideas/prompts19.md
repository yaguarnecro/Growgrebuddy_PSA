This table illustrates the reward distribution for each mini-game in terms of Droops, EXP, Seeds, and Coins. The relative values of High, Medium, and Low indicate the abundance of each reward type in a particular mini-game. For example, Memory Pairs offers a high amount of Droops, while Infinite Bite Runner provides a high amount of Seeds and Coins.

Players can strategize their gameplay based on their desired rewards. If they prioritize Droops, they might focus on Memory Pairs and Story Making. If EXP is their goal, Long List and Simon Says Breath would be suitable choices. Seeds and Coins can be acquired efficiently through Infinite Bite Runner and Story Making.
