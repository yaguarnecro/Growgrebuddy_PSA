# Results - [doingPRDfile.md]

## Result 1
* **Result ID:** 1
* **Link to Prompt:** #prompt-1
* **Result Text:** Based on the project structure we've defined and considering that the API prompts and scripts are not part of the main project, I recommend the following organization:
Move the existing project-related documents from the docs folder to their appropriate places in the new structure.
Create a separate folder outside of the main project structure for your personal scripts and API prompts.
Here's how you could reorganize the existing content:
Project-related documents:
Move docs/proyect_doc/Initial_planning/PRD.md to docs/development/PRD.md
Move docs/proyect_doc/Initial_planning/TechStack.md to docs/development/TechStack.md
Move docs/proyect_doc/Initial_planning/TicketsInitalPlaning.md to docs/development/TicketsInitialPlanning.md
Personal scripts and API prompts:
Create a new folder outside of the main project structure, for example:
This way, you keep your personal scripts and AI prompts separate from the main project structure, which helps maintain a clean and professional project repository.
For the REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md file, you should update it to reflect only the structure of the main project, excluding the personal scripts and AI prompts sections.
Would you like me to provide an updated version of the REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md file reflecting these changes?
ok update @@REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md and the whole repository on   @project_structure.txt 

Certainly! I'll update the REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md file and provide an updated project structure based on our previous discussions and the current state of the project. Here's the updated REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md:

Now, let's update the project_structure.txt file to reflect the new organization:
This updated structure reflects the changes we've discussed, including:
Moving the PRD.md, TechStack.md, and TicketsInitialPlanning.md files to the docs/development/ directory.
Creating a separate workspace folder for personal scripts and AI prompts outside the main project structure.
Organizing the AI prompts into different categories (initial_planning, development, design, testing, deployment).
This structure keeps the main project clean and professional while allowing you to maintain your personal scripts and AI prompts separately.
