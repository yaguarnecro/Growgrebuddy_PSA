* **Result Text:** I apologize for the oversight. You're absolutely right, and we need to adjust our timeline to meet these specific deadlines. Let's rethink the development roadmap with these constraints in mind. As an expert Project Manager, I'll create a more focused and accelerated plan:
Project Phases and Timelines:
Phase 1: Planning and Design (2 weeks: Oct 21 - Nov 3, 2024)
Week 1: Finalize PRD, technical specifications, and initial UI/UX designs
Week 2: Complete technical documentation and project setup
Phase 2: Development (2 weeks: Nov 4 - Nov 17, 2024)
Week 1: Develop core features (virtual mascot, basic game mechanics)
Week 2: Implement essential functionalities and begin integration
Phase 3: MVP Refinement and Testing (2 weeks: Nov 18 - Dec 1, 2024)
Week 1: Finalize MVP features, conduct internal testing
Week 2: Bug fixes, performance optimization, and prepare for launch
Phase 4: MVP Launch (Dec 2, 2024)
Launch MVP version of GrowgrEbuddy_PSA
Key Milestones:
Nov 3, 2024: Complete technical documentation
Nov 17, 2024: Functional working code ready
Dec 2, 2024: MVP launch
Resource Allocation:
2 Full-stack Developers (proficient in both frontend and backend)
1 UI/UX Designer
1 Project Manager (also handling QA)
Development Approach:
Agile methodology with 1-week sprints
Daily stand-ups and end-of-week sprint reviews
Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) to quickly iterate and test
MVP Feature Prioritization:
Focus on core gameplay loop: virtual mascot, basic point system, and one primary virtual space
Implement essential user features: registration, basic profile, and simple habit tracking
Prioritize one mini-game that showcases the app's potential
Post-MVP Launch Plan:
Gather user feedback immediately after launch
Plan for rapid iterations and bug fixes in the first two weeks post-launch
Develop a roadmap for feature expansion based on user feedback and initial performance metrics
This accelerated plan focuses on delivering a functional MVP by the specified deadlines. It prioritizes essential features and emphasizes rapid development and iteration. The team will need to be highly focused and efficient, potentially working longer hours during critical periods.
Key considerations for success:
Clear communication and daily check-ins to quickly address any blockers
Ruthless prioritization of features for the MVP
Streamlined decision-making process to avoid delays
Preparation for potential challenges and having contingency plans
By following this condensed roadmap, we aim to have technical documentation ready by November 3, functional working code by November 17, and launch the MVP on December 2, 2024. This timeline is ambitious but achievable with a dedicated team and focused effort.
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this accelerated plan?
