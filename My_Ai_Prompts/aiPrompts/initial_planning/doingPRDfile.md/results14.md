## Result 1
* **Result ID:** 1
* **Link to Prompt:** #prompt-1
* **Result Text:** Certainly! I'll change the name of the file to "Plan Development Roadmap" and update its content accordingly. Here's the revised file:
I've renamed the file to "Plan_Development_Roadmap.md" and updated the title within the document to "GrowgrEbuddy_PSA Plan Development Roadmap". This change aligns with the description in Ticket 7 and provides a clear indication of the document's purpose.
The content remains the same, as it already addressed the requirements of developing a roadmap with milestones, timelines, and resource allocation, including an update and maintenance schedule.
Is there anything else you'd like me to modify or add to this plan development roadmap?
