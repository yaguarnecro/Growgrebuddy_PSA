* **Result ID:** 1
* **Link to Prompt:** #prompt-1
* **Result Text:** Certainly! I'll improve the format of the Plan_Development_Roadmap.md file to make it more readable and structured. Here's an enhanced version:
This improved format includes:
Numbered sections for easier reference
Checkboxes for tasks to track progress
Tables for better organization of key information
Consistent use of headers and subheaders
Bullet points and nested lists for clarity
A horizontal line to separate the summary from the main content
These changes make the document more visually appealing and easier to navigate, which should help the team stay organized and focused throughout the development process.
