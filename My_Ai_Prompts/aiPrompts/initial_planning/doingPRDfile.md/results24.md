## Result 1
* **Result ID:** 1
* **Link to Prompt:** #prompt-1
* **Result Text:** Certainly! I'll update the TicketsInitalPlaning.md file to mark the completed tickets and fill in the [Date] fields. Based on our progress, I'll assume today's date is the completion date for the finished tickets. Let's update the file:
This updated TicketsInitalPlaning.md file now shows all tickets as completed, with the completion date set to 2024-10-15 for all tickets. Each ticket is marked with a checkbox [x] to indicate it's done, and includes a reference to the relevant documentation where the work for that ticket can be found.
This completes the initial planning and design stage for the GrowgrEbuddy_PSA project. All major aspects of the project have been defined and documented, providing a solid foundation for the development phase.
