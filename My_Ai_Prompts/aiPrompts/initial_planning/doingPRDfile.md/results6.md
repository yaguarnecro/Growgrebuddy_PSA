* **Result Text:** You're absolutely correct, and I apologize for the oversight. Ticket 1, which involves defining the game concept and objectives, has indeed been addressed in the PRD file. Let's update the TicketsInitalPlaning.md to reflect this:
This update marks Ticket 1 as completed and references the relevant sections in the PRD where the game concept, objectives, target audience, user stories, and use cases are detailed. This helps maintain consistency between the tickets and the actual progress of the project as documented in the PRD.
