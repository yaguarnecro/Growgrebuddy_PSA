* **Result Text:** To update the documentation in the development folder to reflect the reduced scope while preserving information about future steps, I would approach it as follows:
Update the PRD.md file:
Simplify the current features and requirements
Add a new section called "Future Enhancements" to outline the features that were removed but could be added later
Modify the TechStack.md file:
Update the current tech stack to the simplified version
Add a section called "Potential Future Technologies" to list the removed technologies
Update the Plan_Development_Roadmap.md:
Adjust the timeline and milestones for the simplified project
Add a section for "Future Development Phases" to outline potential expansions
Revise the GrowgrEbuddy_PSA_Success_Metrics.md:
Simplify the current metrics
Add a section for "Future Success Metrics" to include more advanced KPIs
Update the Development_Tickets.md:
Modify existing tickets to reflect the simplified scope
Add a section for "Future Development Tickets" to outline more complex features
Adjust the GrowgrEbuddy_PSA_Monetization_Strategy.md:
Simplify the current monetization approach
Add a section for "Future Monetization Opportunities"
Modify the GrowgrEbuddy_PSA_Content_Strategy.md:
Reduce the content types and themes
Add a section for "Future Content Expansion"
Update the GrowgrEbuddy_PSA_Testing_Strategy.md:
