# Results - [initial_planning]

## Result 1
* **Result ID:** 1
* **Link to Prompt:** #prompt-1
* **Result Text:** Certainly! I'll create an initial Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on the information found in the markdown files under the "Initial_planning" folder. Then, I'll identify what information is still lacking.
Here's an initial PRD based on the available information:
Information lacking or needing further definition:
Detailed user stories and use cases
Specific success metrics and KPIs
Competitive analysis and market positioning
Detailed technical architecture and stack choices
User onboarding process
Data privacy and security considerations
Localization and internationalization plans
Accessibility features
Push notification strategy
Social features and community engagement plans
Content creation and curation strategy (for prompts, challenges, etc.)
Detailed monetization strategy (pricing tiers, premium features, etc.)
Marketing and user acquisition strategy
Customer support plan
Update and maintenance schedule
Specific timelines for development phases
Budget and resource allocation
Integration with third-party services or APIs
Analytics and reporting features
Beta testing and soft launch plans
To create a more comprehensive PRD, we would need to gather information on these missing elements. This would involve further discussions with stakeholders, market research, technical planning sessions, and potentially user surveys or focus groups to validate assumptions and gather additional insights.
