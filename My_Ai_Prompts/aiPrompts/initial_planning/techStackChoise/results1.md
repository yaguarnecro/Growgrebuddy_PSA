    * What framework or library will we use for building the web interface (React, Angular, Vue.js)?
    * What CSS preprocessor will we use for styling (Sass, Less, Stylus)?
    * Will we use a component library (Material UI, Bootstrap, Ant Design)?
* **Mobile App:**
    * Should we develop native apps for iOS and Android using Swift/Objective-C and Kotlin/Java, respectively?
    * Or should we use a cross-platform framework like React Native, Flutter, or Ionic?

### **2. Backend Development**

* **Programming Language:**
    * Which programming language will we use for the backend (Python, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, .NET)?
