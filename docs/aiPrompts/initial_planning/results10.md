# Results - [initial_planning]

## Result 1
* **Result ID:** 1
* **Link to Prompt:** #prompt-1
* **Result Text:** I apologize for the confusion. It seems I didn't apply the changes in my previous response. You're right to point that out. Let's apply the changes now to solve the first ticket. I'll update the PRD with the new sections we discussed earlier.
Here's the updated PRD with the changes applied:
These changes address the requirements of Ticket 1 by providing a detailed description of the game concept, objectives, and target audience, including user stories and use cases. The new sections (2. Game Concept, 3. Objectives, 5. User Stories, and 6. Use Cases) offer a comprehensive understanding of the app's purpose and how users will interact with it.
The existing content has been preserved, with new sections added to enhance the document. This updated PRD now provides a more complete picture of the GrowgrEbuddy_PSA app, which will be valuable for both the development team and stakeholders.
