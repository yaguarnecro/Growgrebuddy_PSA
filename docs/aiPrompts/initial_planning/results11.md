# Results - [initial_planning]

## Result 1
* **Result ID:** 1
* **Link to Prompt:** #prompt-1
* **Result Text:** Certainly! I'll modify the PRD to reflect that the app will be developed to work both on browsers and Android cellphones. I'll also update the README.md file accordingly. Let's start with the changes to the PRD:

These changes reflect the updated platform support for both web browsers and Android devices. The PRD now specifies the technical requirements for both platforms, and the README.md file provides an overview of the project with the updated platform information.
You may need to create a CONTRIBUTING.md file if it doesn't exist yet, and add any specific license information to the README.md.
Is there anything else you'd like me to update or modify regarding these changes?
