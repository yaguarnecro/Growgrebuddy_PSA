# Results - [initial_planning]

## Result 1
* **Result ID:** 1
* **Link to Prompt:** #prompt-1
* **Result Text:** After reviewing the current list of tickets for the initial planning and design stage, I believe we should modify and expand it to address the information gaps identified in the PRD. Here's a suggested update to the list:
These updated tickets should help ensure that we gather all the necessary information for a comprehensive PRD and address the gaps identified earlier. The new tickets cover areas such as detailed user stories, success metrics, monetization strategy, content planning, and more technical aspects like analytics and customer support.
Would you like me to update the file with these changes?
