Ticket 1: Define Game Concept and Objectives
Description: Create a detailed description of the game concept, objectives, and target audience. Include user stories and use cases.
Assignee: [Name]
Due Date: [Date]
To address this ticket, we'll need to expand on the existing information in the PRD and add more details about the game concept, objectives, and target audience. We'll also include user stories and use cases to provide a clearer picture of how users will interact with the app.
Before making changes, I'll explain the approach:
We'll add a new section called "Game Concept" to provide a more detailed description of the game.
We'll expand on the objectives of the app, linking them to the key features.
We'll provide more information about the target audience, including personas.
We'll add user stories to illustrate how different users might interact with the app.
We'll include use cases to demonstrate specific scenarios of app usage.
These additions will help stakeholders and developers better understand the vision for the app and how it will be used.
Now, let's make the changes to the PRD. I'll provide the updated sections:
